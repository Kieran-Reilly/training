# Fast array processing

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to include some concepts of meta programming.  
This basically comes down to one of two ideas.

1. Program that changes itself based on conditions
2. Code that writes code

You will be excused for thinking there is a AI component too this as in many cases it does.
In this case however we are going to write the code ourself.

## Processing data
There are a lot of examples where you want to process data and based conditions manipulate that data.  
Generating aggregate functions is a example of that.  
This can become very slow where you run loops in loops to process the data and calculate values.

## Project
1. You get a random array with data where each object in the array has the same properties.
1. Create a processor that will understand the data structure and how to process it.
1. Loop through the array and use the processor to evaluate each record.
1. Print out the resulting data generated during the processor operations.

While generating the processor you need to evaluate the field type dynamically.  
This is done by using the first record as a sampeling.  
Fields that are ranged should contain a min value, max value, ave value and all the unique values in that array.
Such fields are number and date fields.
All other fields should result in an array where only the unique values are displayed with an aggregate value of how many times that value appears in the array.

## Example
[{value: 10, code: "a"}, {value: 10, code: "a"}, {value: 20, code: "a"}, {value: 30, code: "b"}]

There are two fields:

1. value  - determine the min, max and ave and all the unique values [10, 20, 30]
1. code - determine the unique values ["a", "b"] and the count aggregate [{"a": 3}, {"b": 1}]

You can use any data structure that represents this information best.

## NB
This should not be hardcoded operations, if I remove or add an field the result data should reflect that.

## Example process

```js
const data = getData();
const processor = generateProcessor(data[0]);
for (const item of data) {
  processor.process(item)
}
console.log(processor.result);
```
 
## Conclusion
Create an dynamic optimised processor for a given data structure that will summerise the data and return you a processed result.  
The processor code is generated at runtime and optimised for the given data structure.  
Processing 1000,000 records should take less than one second on a average machine.
