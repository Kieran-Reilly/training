#HTML and Layout

#Introduction
Html defines the parts you use to define UI.  
CSS is used to perform layout and styling.  

There is a subtle problem here.  
A lot of times people will use HTML markup to define layout but CSS today for the most part allows you not to have to do that.

## HTML
HTML markup is not just for defining visuals. 
You also need to consider screen readers and scrapers.  
These technologies help determine the propularity of your website and also enable physically disabled people use it.  
Learning all this off from the start can become a bit much too chew so for starters we will ignore that but look at it in future.

## CSS
There are a lot of devices that consume your website or application these days.  

1. Desktop devices
1. Phones
1. Tablets
1. Embedded systems ...

The goal here is to write the markup once but efficiently render it on the different form factors of the different devices.
The moment you rely on HTML to assist in this you are creating yourself a lot of problems.  
The rule I live by is this: if you can do it in css, do it in css.  
In a way your understanding of CSS is more cirtical than HTML.  
It is also more complicated and requires more practice.
