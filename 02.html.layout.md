# HTML and Layout

## Introduction
Html defines the parts you use to define UI.  
CSS is used to perform layout and styling.  

There is a subtle problem here.  
A lot of times people will use HTML markup to define layout but CSS today, for the most part, allows you not to have to do that.

## HTML
HTML markup is not just for defining visuals. 
You also need to consider screen readers and scrapers.  
These technologies help determine the popularity of your website and also enable physically disabled people to use it.  
Learning all this off from the start can become a bit much too chew so for starters we will ignore that but look at it in future.

Here is a list of HTML elements

There are a lot of elements in there but for starters, you should have a firm grasp the elements between:

1. from - main root
1. to - content section

The text part will be looked at in subsequent lessons. 

## CSS
There are a lot of devices that consume your website or application these days.  

1. Desktop devices
1. Phones
1. Tablets
1. Embedded systems ...

The goal here is to write the markup once but efficiently render it on the different form factors of the different devices.
The moment you rely on HTML to assist in this you are creating yourself a lot of problems.  
The rule I live by is this: if you can do it in CSS, do it in CSS.  
In a way, your understanding of CSS is more critical than HTML.  
It is also more complicated and requires more practice.

The first thing you need to learn in CSS is layout.
There are two main types of layouts you need to understand in today's world.
Responsive layout
Adaptive layout
By understanding, problem spaces these two methods solve, you can decide what layout strategy makes the most sense for what you are trying to do.  Have a look at [this article](http://mediumwell.com/responsive-adaptive-mobile/) for a better understanding.

We will not expect you to apply these in your first project so at this stage a surface level of understanding will suffice. The reason why we bring your attention to this now is two-fold:

It brings home the fact that you should not use HTML for layout but instead CSS.
You need to structure your first project in such a way that you can easily adapt it in the future to be responsive or adaptive. 

I have found [this site](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/) to be a useful resource when looking at CSS.
