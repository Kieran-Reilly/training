# Start learning dev tools
The browsers are packed with features that help you as a developer.  
The different browser venders release new dev tool updates on a regular basis and keeping up to date with the tools can only help you in your development.

I am personally use the chrome dev tools though in my opinion they are all very good.

Now you need to start getting use to the tools.  
At the very minimum you need to be able too:

1. Debug styles
1. Debug javascript
1. Monitor file transfer and detect borken url
1. Be comfortable with using the browser console
1. In some dev tools you can also set up workspaces so that changes you make in the browser will be saved to your project files.

Here are some resources for you too look at:
