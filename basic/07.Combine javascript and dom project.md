# Javascript and the dom basics project
At some stage you need to start manipulating the UI and perform some logic using javascript. This project will help you get started with this.

## Core features you need to understand
1. How do I [find a given element on the dom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector).
1. How do I [create a element using javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement).
1. How do I [add a element to the dom using javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)
1. How can I [be alerted when a user clicks on something](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
1. How do I read values from the screen and write too the screen

For this project you also need to learn and practice using the [debuggin tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript). If you prefer usig other browsers, they have similar tools, just google the browser name and debugging.

## The screen
Create a html file that we can use to create a person object .
There should be three [inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with corresponding [label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) elements.
One for each property for the person class we created in the previous projects.
1. First Name
1. Last Name
1. Age

Add three buttons

1. Create person
1. Walk person
1. Stop person

We also need a div that will show the person's status.

## Screen logic
All the buttons are [disabled](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_disabled.asp) by default.  
All the input elements are [required](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp).  
When all the input's have values the create button is enabled by [removing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute) the disabled attribute from the button.

Create a instance of the person class and set the properties, first name, last name and age equal to the values typed in the corresponding input.  
Once the person class instance is created, disable the create button and the three inputs by [adding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute) the disabled attribute on those elements. Also enable the walk and stop walking buttons.

When you click on the walk or stop walking buttons, call the corresponding functions on the person class and set the status [div's text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) to the status of the person.

If the person is walking, the div's text color should be green. If not the text should be red. Too achieve this create a [css class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) for walking and not walking. You should [add and remove the classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) from the status div as required.

## Using properties to work with the dom.

Accessing the dom is expensive and it is often a good idea to cache a element once you have feched it but this can cause memory leaks if you don't free that reference again.
Using object properties for this is a great way to fetch a element once and ensure that you free it again easily.
Look at the following code below.

```js
class ViewModel {
    get myElement() {
        // if the element does not exist, fetch it and cache it
        if (this._myElement == null) {
            this._myElement = document.querySelector("my-element");
        }

        // return the cached item
        return this._myElement;
    }

    set myElement(newValue) {
        // used to set the reference and also clean it by setting it to null in the dipsose
        this._myElement = newValue;
    }

    dispose() {
        // set the reference pointer to null so that garbage collection can happen
        myElement = null;
    }
}
```

When you do it this way you also fetch the element only when you actually need to use it, this makes things a bit more memory efficient.

```js
let viewModel = new ViewModel();
viewModel.myElement.innerText = "Hello World";
viewModel.myElement.style.background = "blue";
viewModel.dispose();
viewModel = null;
```

In the above code, myElement is only fetched once you need it.
Once it has been fetched is is cached so when you access it a second time it does not query the dom but instead uses the field you populated the first time round.
Once we are done we call the dipose function to clear the view model's memory.
At this point the element reference is nulled allowing the view model to be garbage collected when we set it to null.

## Event handeling

Adding events are done by addEventListener function on the element that you are listening on.
For example if you want to know when a button was clicked then you would listen on the click event on the button element.

1. Get the button element using the querySelector function of the document `document.querySelector("#btnAccept");`
1. You need to create a handler to the function you want to call. Remember to use the [.bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) function to enforce what "this" means in the event handler.
1. Remember to remove the event handler when you are done with it.


```js
create() {
    this.clickHandler = this.click.bind(this);
    this.button.addEventHandler("click", this.clickHandler);
}

dispose() {
    this.button.removeEventHandler("click", this.clickHandler);
    this.clickHandler = null;
}
```
