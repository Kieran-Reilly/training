# Javascript project
This project will have different exercises that will help you learn the absolute basics of javascript.

All names should be camel case.
When defining a class the class Name should be pascal case.
The instance of a class should be camel case again.
File and folder names are lowercase.

With camel case, the first letter of the word is lowercase and each new word starts with a capital letter. For example "helloWorld"

With pascal case, the first letter is a capital letter and each new word's first letter. For example "HelloWorld"

## Exercise 1
Create a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.
This function should be in a file called calculator.js and exported using es6 modules. In the index.html file, import the add function and execute it with any two numbers fed to the functions parameters. Print the result using the "console.log" function.

When you open your browser's developer tools you should see your result in the console.

## Exercise 2
Let's add another function to the calculator.js file and call it "addNumbers". This function can accept any number of values.
Use [spread operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to help you here. As with the first exercise call this function from index.html and lot the result.

## Exercise 3
Create a file called person.js. This file should export a class called "Person". 

The person [class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) has the following properties.
1. First Name
1. Last Name
1. Age

It also has the following functions. 

1. Start walking. 
1. Stop walking. 

When start walking is called you need to set a private field "is walking" to true, stop walking set's the same field back to false. The default value of this field is false and should be set to false in the [constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor) of the class.

Now add a read-only property (property with a [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) but no [setter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) called status. If the field "is walking" is true the result of the property should be a string like this: "NameValue LastNameValue is walking" where NameValue and LastName value is the first name of the instance and the last name of the instance. If the value is false the result of status should be "NameValue LastName is idle".

Please note that private members in javascript has a "_" prefix to the name. For example, the private function "do something" would be "_doSomething".

Create another file called people.js and import the person class in this file. Create two new classes that inherit the "person" class. The one class should be called JoeDirt and the other MileyCirus. In the constructors of these classes set their name, last name and age properties to appropriate values. Remember to use the [super](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super) keyword where appropriate.

Hint: set the "is walking"  field on the parent class but the first and last name on the persons. Ensure you call the super on the persons' constructors.

In the index.html file import JoeDirt and MileyCirus and create instances for each one. Tell them to move using the start walking function and print out their moving status. Tell them to stop using the stop walking function and print out their moving status.

# Exercise 4

This project will be using async code so you need to know how to use async code and that means promises also.
Here are some resources you can use:
1. [Playlist on promises and async](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjngZXVn48vYmPK_1yAF-fLw)
1. [Documentation on promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
1. [Documentation on async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)

For this project you need to download three text files, compbine their content and console log out the result.

1. Async download the three text files.
1. Once all the files are downloaded combine them into a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
1. Write the result to the DOM so that the browser will render the downloaded content.

The files you need to download are:

1. https://github.com/caperaven/training/blob/master/files/1_p.md
1. https://github.com/caperaven/training/blob/master/files/2_p.md
1. https://github.com/caperaven/training/blob/master/files/3_p.md

Since you can't download these directly from git you will need to create copies of these files in your project in a folder called documents. You will download the files from there. Use the [fetch api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to [download the files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs).

You should seperate the concerns and should have async functions that:

1. download the files and construct the result text
2. write the result text to the document

The three files should be downloaded at the same time.  
The result should only be constructed once all the files have been downloaded.
