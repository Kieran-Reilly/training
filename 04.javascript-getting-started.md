# Javascript
Javascript is the primary programming language used to develop functionality in the browser. With the advent of webassembly, the future balance between javascript and webassembly remains to be seen. The current consensus is that there is a place for both and learning javascript is still very much worth your while.

There is a lot of noise around javascript as it's a pretty old language. 
If you are not familiar with programming you will need to become familiar with programming concepts first. See the introduction section for developer resources. 

In javascript, you can do both: 

1. [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and 
1. [object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). 

Some people argue the merit of their chosen paradigm.  
I am not a purist in this regard but rather a pragmatist.  
Use what makes sense for what you are trying to do and if required mix them.  
I think some purists just dropped dead at their chairs.

Either way, the best place to start is embracing the new and abandoning the old.  
You can embrace the older stuff again as you mature.  
I would venture to say you should start by learning ECMA script 6 also known as es6.

Let us use an example of this.  
In Javascript old, you would declare a variable using the "var" keyword.  
Using es6 you would rather use the "const" or "let" keywords.  
I would go as far as to say, make everything "const" by default and if you happen to override the value, later on, change it to a "let".  
In my team, we have a rule, NEVER user "var".  

As we go through the training modules we will focus on different parts of the language.  
At the very minimum, when you get started you must know the following:

1. [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) and [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
1. [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
1. Declaring [constants](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
1. [Es6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

## Seperation of concern
A very good pattern to get to grips with early on is [seperation of concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)  
Any modular code or part needs to answer to these questions:  

Q: What are you concerned about,   
Q: what are you trying to do,  
Q: what is your purpose for being?   

The answer should always be one thing.
When it is trying to do more than one thing you need to refactor it so that it is only concerned with one thing.

This applies in particular to things like functions and classes.

## JSDoc
Commenting code is very important for maintaining code in teams and also to help you make sense out of code when you come back to it long after you have written it. You can also use comments to help you develop. For these examples we will us [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) as it is well supported in most all proper IDE for javascript.

For this example we are going to use seperation of concern with commenting to plan our code before we actually write it.  
We start by creating the class and function husks.  

```js
/**
 * This class is a disposable base class for people and provides common features for all people
 */
class Person {
    /**
     * @constructor
     */
    constructor() {
    }

    /**
     * destructor for cleaning up memory before you null the instance
     */
    dispose() {

    }

    /**
     * This function communicates a message to those who may be listening
     * @param {string} message - what should the person say
     */
    speak(message) {

    }
}
```

Starting your code this way gives you a clear indication on what this object does and the concern of it and it's parts.
You can do the same to inside functions using normal comments to help keep track of complex logic before you even start writing it.

```js
/**
 * Copy events from store items over
 * @param {StoreItem} source - the source to copy from  
 * @param {StoreItem} target - the target to copy too
 */
function copyStoreItem(source, target) {
    // 1. check if the source and target meets requirements
    
    // 2. copy the events from the source to the target
    
    // 3. perform cleanup on source
}
```

How all that is left for us to do is fill in the blanks of the logic and the comments will help us keep track of what needs to be done.
Commenting code before you start is better than commenting code after the fact as it helps you first think through what you want to do and how before you get started.
