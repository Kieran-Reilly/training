# Javascript
Javascript is the primary programming language used to develop functionality in the browser. With the advent of webassembly, the future balance between javascript and webassembly remains to be seen. The current consensus is that there is a place for both and learning javascript is still very much worth your while.

There is a lot of noise around javascript as it's a pretty old language. 
If you are not familiar with programming you will need to become familiar with programming concepts first. See the introduction section for developer resources. 

In javascript, you can do both: 

1. [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and 
1. [object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). 

Some people argue the merit of their chosen paradigm.  
I am not a purist in this regard but rather a pragmatist.  
Use what makes sense for what you are trying to do and if required mix them.  
I think some purists just dropped dead at their chairs.

Either way, the best place to start is embracing the new and abandoning the old.  
You can embrace the older stuff again as you mature.  
I would venture to say you should start by learning ECMA script 6 also known as es6.

Let us use an example of this.  
In Javascript old, you would declare a variable using the "var" keyword.  
Using es6 you would rather use the "const" or "let" keywords.  
I would go as far as to say, make everything "const" by default and if you happen to override the value, later on, change it to a "let".  
In my team, we have a rule, NEVER user "var".  

As we go through the training modules we will focus on different parts of the language.  
At the very minimum, when you get started you must know the following:

1. [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) and [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
1. [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
1. Declaring [constants](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) and [variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let)
1. [Es6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
