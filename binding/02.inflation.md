# Inflation project

## Introduction
In this project we are going to use the inflation engine of crs-binding.  
Inflation is the process where we populate a template with data using the binding engine to define where the data goes.

Read the binding engine documentation on [static ui](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding-documentation/blob/master/5.%20static-ui.md) for more details.
