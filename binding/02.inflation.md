# Inflation project

## Introduction
In this project we are going to use the inflation engine of crs-binding.  
Inflation is the process where we populate a template with data using the binding engine to define where the data goes.

Read the binding engine documentation on [static ui](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding-documentation/blob/master/5.%20static-ui.md) for more details.

## Details
In this project we are going to use the inflation engine to build this UI.

In this project you are going to need the following HTML for the checked and unchecked images.

```html
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="display: none;">
    <symbol id="checked" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2zm-2 15l-5-5 1.41-1.41L10 14.17l7.59-7.59L19 8l-9 9z"/>
    </symbol>

    <symbol id="unchecked" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"/><path d="M14.59 8L12 10.59 9.41 8 8 9.41 10.59 12 8 14.59 9.41 16 12 13.41 14.59 16 16 14.59 13.41 12 16 9.41 14.59 8zM12 2C6.47 2 2 6.47 2 12s4.47 10 10 10 10-4.47 10-10S17.53 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.41 0-8-3.59-8-8s3.59-8 8-8 8 3.59 8 8-3.59 8-8 8z"/>
    </symbol>
</svg>
```

You will use these in your template.  

```html
<svg class="icon">
    <use xlink:href="... binding expression goes here ..." />
</svg>
``` 

You will use CSS grid to perform the layout in a element with class "container".

```html
<div id="container"></div>
```

In this example you will need to append the document fragment generated by the inflation engine into the container element.
A single template is used to define all the elements seen in the images.
1. Headers
1. First column with names
1. Checked / unchecked cells

To do this the template will have to cater for all the scenarios but turn elements visible and invisible depending on some conditions.
The data structure you use for the rendering is important but that is not part of what we are trying to accomplish here.  
You can use [this code to generate the data](https://github.com/caperaven/crs-binding/blob/master/app/inflation/data.js) for you.

Look at the resulting data structure to figure out how you should construct the template and what binding is required.
