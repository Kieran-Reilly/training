# Doing batch updates to the dom
When working with the dom it is very slow to add elements one at a time.  
For this project we are going to create a list based UI where all the list items are added at once.

## Project details
Create this [list UI](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1591610/screenshots/4426221/to-do_shot.jpg)
The list must be created using javascript and should be dynamic.
If I change the list the UI should update showing the new list.

For the list structure you need to use [templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template).  
When constructing the list items to add to the UI you must use [document fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createDocumentFragment).

## Notes
This project is now starting to move you towards performance orientated programming.
You need to understand how the template element affects the dom during parsing.
You also need to understand why the document fragment is a more performant way to add items to the screen.

Your studies now need to include browser behaviour and performance.
A good place to start is the google developer documentation for [web performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering)

The screenshot is of a mobile view but this should be responsive so that it works equally great on mobile and desktop.
Take special care form now on to ensure proper folder structure is maintained and that all projects are responsive.
