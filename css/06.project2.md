## Before you start
This project is a simple menu with three layers.

1. The first layer is the visible menu items.
1. Once you hover over a item it shows layer 2, the drop down items.
1. If a drop down item has sub items and you hover over it it shows layer 3, the side items.

These menus are build up using UL and LI elements.  
Sub menus are done by placing a UL in a LI.  
Note that submenu UL is made invisible by setting it's display to none.

We will be giving you less hints on how to build this stuff from this point forward.

## Project details
Create a simple menu.  
The page has a gradient from `cornflowerblue` to `#03A9F4`.  
The text color is white;  
The menu is must use a nav element and be at the top center of the screen.  
Sub menu items have a background of `#266fed`.  
When you hover on a menu item the background changes to `#e91e63`.  
Each menu item in a sub menu has a white line under it. Note that the last item in the list does not.  

When introducing the sub menu there is a bit of a animation.  
The menu moves in from the top and the distanced moved in the animation is 1rem.
