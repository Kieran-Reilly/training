This project is a simple project but it has some interesting bits too it.
This time round you do not get the HTML and you will need to construct all the parts as you see fit.

## Project details
Create a card that has a header and paragraph as seen in the above image.
It also has a red shape at the top left corner of color `#e91e63`.
The background of the card being `#266fed` and the text color white;

The header uses a stained glass kind of effect with the text cut out.
You will notice a blured effect behind the stained glass where the red objects border is.
When you hover your mouse over the item, the circle grows to fill the card and when removing the mouse, it goes back to normal.

This project is pure css and no images are used.
That includes no svg.
