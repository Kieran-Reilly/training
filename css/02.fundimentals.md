# Fundamentals

## Introduction
CSS has a lot to learn, some parts old, others new.  
There are however some parts of css that you use a lot.  
These frequently used parts we will refer to as the fundamentals.

1. selectors - how do I find the element I want to make changes on
1. properties - what changes do I want to make on the selected elements
1. functions - helper functions build into css
1. pseudo-classes - classes that define or react to a element's state or relative position

Read the [csswg documentation](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-3/) for in depth detail.

## Performance
This might seem like something you should look at last.  
By dealing with performance early on, as you learn more about css, you should have an idea of todo and don't do.

For now it is good enough to watch [this video on css performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rn8an74khk).  
Note that this video is pretty old already but still relevant.

## Selectors
CSS selectors it not just important for CSS but can also be used in javascript in conjunction with

1. document.querySelector
1. document.querySelectorAll

There are different type of selectors that can be used in combination with each other.

1. [Type selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors)
1. [Class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors)
1. [ID selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
1. [Universal selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors)
1. [Attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)

You can also [string different selectors together](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list).  
This helps you avoid duplicating css.

Important rules around selectors:

1. Keep your selectors statements short. 
1. Simpler statements run faster. Use id selectors or class selectors where you can as they are often most direct.
1. Use universal selectors very sparingly.

## Properties
Here is a list of basic properties you will use a lot

1. [background](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/)

There are some others that you may use depending on your display property value.

1. top
1. bottom
1. left
1. right

Documentation can be [found here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/top-right-bottom-left/).

Since you often work with lists be they ordered or unordered you certainly will need to style them.

1. [list-style](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/l/list-style/)

## Functions
There are a number of functions out there for you to use but the most common ones are

1. [attr](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/attr/)
1. [calc](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/calc/)

## Pseudo-classes
There are a number of [pseudo classes](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/#section_css-pseudo-class) and though this is a bit more than just the basics they are commonly used.
