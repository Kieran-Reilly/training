# The observer pattern
[This pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is mostly used in infrastructure code like binding engines but has other uses also.

This is an important pattern for event-driven code and you need a way to be notified that a property changed.

Javascript [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow you to create traps and build the infrastructure required to make the observer pattern work. It is important to note that these traps are not just for properties but all members of the object.

## Project
Create a project that wraps the person's class.
Put a UI on this so that you have an input per field as you did in previous projects.
When the following fields have these values you need to alert "found you John"

1. firstName: "John"
1. lastName: "Doe"
1. age: 20

When you get the age of the person the trap has to limit the high value to 30.  
Thus if the person's age is 40 it will still return 30.
