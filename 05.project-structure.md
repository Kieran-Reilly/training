# Folder structures
This may seem like a trivial subject but is not.  
It is one thing when your project has one or two files but  
when you are working on a project with many files and many different file types, how you manage your project becomes very important and affects your productivity and the maintainability of the project.

A different subject but along the same lines is naming conventions.  
What you name things matter when it comes to understanding where what code is located at.

One of the traps that people fall in is to put all their code in one file or to mix different concerns in one file.   
You don't need to do this. It is perfectly ok to structure your code so that things that belong together are grouped.  
This achieved through proper folder structures and files.

There are some industry standards around certain files:

1. your default starting file should be called "index.html"
1. if you have an associated javascript file, call it "index.js"
1. place your CSS files in the style folder located in the project root. you can have subfolders to better manage and organize your styles.

With the advent of http2, you don't need to rely on bundling when isolating logic in its relevant files.  
Bundling is a subject for a different training session but the point is this.  
When hosting with http2 you don't pay the penalty anymore for spreading your logic over different smaller files instead of fewer larger ones.

Proper file management will allow you to load resources when you need them.  
This will enhance load times, memory footprint and processing.  
When on mobile this also affects the cost of downloading your content.

Give proper attention to how you structure your projects.
