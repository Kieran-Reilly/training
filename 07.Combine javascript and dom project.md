# Javascript and the dom basics project
At some stage you need to start manipulating the UI and perform some logic using javascript. This project will help you get started with this.

## Core features you need to understand
1. How do I [find a given element on the dom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector).
1. How do I [create a element using javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement).
1. How do I [add a element to the dom using javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)
1. How can I [be alerted when a user clicks on something](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
1. How do I read values from the screen and write too the screen

For this project you also need to learn and practice using the [debuggin tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript). If you prefer usig other browsers, they have similar tools, just google the browser name and debugging.

## The screen
Create a html file that we can use to create a person object .
There should be three [inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with corresponding [label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) elements.
One for each property for the person class we created in the previous projects.
1. First Name
1. Last Name
1. Age

Add three buttons

1. Create person
1. Walk person
1. Stop person

We also need a div that will show the person's status.

## Screen logic
All the buttons are [disabled](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_disabled.asp) by default.  
All the input elements are [required](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp).  
When all the input's have values the create button is enabled by [removing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/removeAttribute) the disabled attribute from the button.

Create a instance of the person class and set the properties, first name, last name and age equal to the values typed in the corresponding input.  
Once the person class instance is created, disable the create button and the three inputs by [adding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute) the disabled attribute on those elements. Also enable the walk and stop walking buttons.

When you click on the walk or stop walking buttons, call the corresponding functions on the person class and set the status [div's text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) to the status of the person.

If the person is walking, the div's text color should be green. If not the text should be red. Too achieve this create a [css class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) for walking and not walking. You should [add and remove the classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) from the status div as required.
